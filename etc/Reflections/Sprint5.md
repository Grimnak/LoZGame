Similarly to Sprint 4 and Sprint 5 we already had an effective strategy for completing  our sprints. 
We realized early on in the semester that our best course of action was to work hardest to finish tasks in the beginning of the sprint to allow for more time for dealing with bugs, merges, and refactors. 
We began with our typical planning session where we planned and assigned tasks. The only difference for this sprint was that we had to brainstorm additional features. 
We’ve been brainstorming ideas for a few Sprints but we had to cement our final ideas during our Sprint 5 planning.
Once we settled down on additional features and assigned tasks, we broke up and began working on our parts. We focused on finishing and merging the major pieces in the first week so we could spend extra time testing for bugs.
After we did finish merging major pieces we extensively tested and documented bugs. Then we were able to focus our efforts on fixing these bugs and smoothing out our game.
Lastly we were able to address our grader’s feedback and make some changes she recommended. 
Overall, this sprint ran similarly to our past two, aside from doing extra testing and having one less week for work.
