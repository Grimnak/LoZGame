To start Sprint 4, our group began with our typical planning meeting where we fleshed out what needed to be done, created issues on our taskboard, assigned weights to these issues, and assigned people to tasks. With this being one of the later sprints in the semester, we had already found an effective method for approaching our work and completing a successful sprint. This method involves starting early, working on modular pieces, and commiting and merging early and often.
We followed this same strategy and began to knock out the most important parts of the Sprint in the first week. These tasks included last bits of functionality for dungeon 2 enemies, audio, screen transitions, and the inventory/HUD features. We found these tasks to be more time consuming than expected which led us to spend the first week and a half without completing many major issues, as seen in the burndown chart. 
While working consistently throughout the entire sprint we began to knock out most of our issues in the last week of the sprint. When most of our required elements were in the game we were able to put our efforts towards refactoring and cleaning up our game. That being said, we refactored to make our game more robust and worked on removing magic numbers and strings.
Due to our accelerated workrate we had plenty of time to work on completing dungeon 2 in order to get a jump on the next sprint.
