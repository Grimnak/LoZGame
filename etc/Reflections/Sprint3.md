In our first team sprint, Sprint 2, our major takeaway was to begin working earlier and merging smaller modular sections instead of a large convoluted merge late in the sprint. Keeping this in mind, we immediately split up and prioritized tasks. We highly prioritized difficult tasks that involved a large time commitment and also tasks that were dependencies for other tasks, like XML reading and level loading. We began to work on these top tasks immediately and incrementally merged improvements into our main develop branch. Level loading and XML reading were among the first features to be implemented, which allowed us to build off of that and have over 2 weeks to test and redesign. Following the completion of the major tasks, with the exclusion of collision handling, we were able to focus our efforts on improving functionality of projectiles, enemies, blocks, and doors, as well as major refactoring, and addressing Sprint 2’s comments. Collision handling work persisted throughout the entire sprint but was made very modular to allow updates to not break other working parts. This workflow has led to a much cleaner, less backloaded Sprint 3, and allowed for much more code review time to improve readability and limit bugs. We will be continuing with this process of knocking the toughest tasks out very early in the following sprints.
