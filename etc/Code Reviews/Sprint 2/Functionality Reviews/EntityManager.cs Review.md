# Code Functionality Review

### Author: Ryan

### Date: 02/16/2020

### Sprint No.: Sprint 2

### File Name: ./LoZGame/Managers/EntityManagers/EntityManager.cs

### File Author Name: Aaron Rehfeldt

### Time Taken to Review: ## minutes

### Comments on Quality:
- High Cohesion in methods makes functionality clear and to the point 
- Low coupling in methods makes the functionality simple
- Clear method is a good addition to reset projectiles and explosions for future sprints

### Potential Change to improve functionality
- Possible option is to include logic to clear certain elements of explosion and projectiles but not all
Is feasible but may not be the best solution to include that logic here.
