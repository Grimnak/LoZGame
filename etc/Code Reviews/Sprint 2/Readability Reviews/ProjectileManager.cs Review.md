###  Comments on What is Readable
- Switch statement makes code much more concise.
- Field and function naming is clear allowing for understanding at a quick glance.
- Long function calls with lots of parameters make code slightly less readable at first. 
However, shortening the calls may be tricky due to params being absolutely necessary in these calls.
