###  Comments on What is Readable
- The dictionary as it is adding all of the various commands to it is extremely recognizable and clean.
- The command classes are all named something very intuitive and are easy to understand.
- The get properties are aptly named getIdle and getDict, clearly indicating which private field they serve.
- Overall, this file and code structure are very well-named and factored very well.  Someone who has never seen this code before could easily understand everything it does without much time invested.
