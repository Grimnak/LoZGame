###  Comments on What is Readable
- Easy to understand what methods do (OnCollisionResponse is what happens when the object responds to a collision, etc).
- Variables intuitively named for the most part.
- One thing that could be better is to comment what the ApplySmallSpeed(Weight)Mod methods are for, and what they really mean for the enemy itself.
