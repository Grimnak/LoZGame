### Comments on Quality:
- Good selection of features to change about the game.
- User interface is easy to understand, although it could be slightly better (see suggestion below).
- Good use of enums to represent each feature in the options menu.

### Potential Change to improve functionality
- Add an icon to indicate to the user that they click a certain button to adjust the setting (e.g. arrows to increase/decrease level difficulty). It isn't immediately clear that the user should click 'return' to change a setting.
	This is relatively feasible; all it would involve is finding and adding icon sprites to the menu, along with adjusting keyboard settings.
