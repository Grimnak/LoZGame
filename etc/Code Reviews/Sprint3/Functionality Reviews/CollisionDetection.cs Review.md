# Code Functionality Review

### Author: Sammy Lisa

### Sprint No.: 3

### File Name: ./LoZGame/Collisions/CollisionDetection.cs

### File Author Name: Eric Henderson

### Time Taken to Review: 15 minutes

###  Comments on What is Readable
- the functions are split in a very intuitive way, with each game object's collisions being cycled through.
- the dirty work of collision detection is separated into another class (CollisionEssentials), allowing for this class to be organized in a simple manner.
- variables, methods, and class names are appropriately named so that I can understand what's going on with no comments needed.
