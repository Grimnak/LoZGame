###  Comments on What is Readable
- Public bool to enable and disable music is very useful and easy to see
- Each method is descriptive and makes sence. Easy to incorporate new sound effects anywhere in the game without hunting down the file to see exactly what effect we are adding
- Stop music methods are really easy to understand and see. Giving us more control over what plays when.
