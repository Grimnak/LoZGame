###  Comments on What is Readable
- Good use of comments to make it clear what functions are and why they aren't necessary for this state
- Good use of encapsulation to limit the size of functiosn, particularly in the draw method
- Doc Comments make it clear what functions are as well, and using the inheritdoc makes it more concise by sharing the same documentation for all gameStates.
