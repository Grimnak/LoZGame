###  Comments on What is Readable
- Greate use of enumerated values instead of using strings to identify the items themselves.
- Well-named variables and methods, allowing a new reader to easily understand what you're trying to accomplish.
- Consider moving the public accessors to a helper class to further improve readability and reduce file clutter.
