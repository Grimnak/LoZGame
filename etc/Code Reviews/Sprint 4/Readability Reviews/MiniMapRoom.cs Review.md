###  Comments on What is Readable
- Instance fields need comments briefly explaining their function. Why is DotLayer 1 while MapLayer is 0.9999 and BackgroundLayer is 0.9?
- this.visited can be modified with a public property. The method Explore() is not necessary.
- The switch case in the DrawDoors() function should be abstracted into different components or files. We need to avoid using switch cases if we want to add 3 additional dungeons for Sprint 5.
- Other methods are under 10 lines, making them simple and easy to understand.
